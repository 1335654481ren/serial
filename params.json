{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Serial","body":"This is a cross-platform library for interfacing with rs-232 serial like ports written in C++. It provides a modern C++ interface with a workflow designed to look and feel like PySerial, but with the speed and control provided by C++. \r\n\r\nThis library is in use in several robotics related projects and can be built and installed to the OS like most unix libraries with make and then sudo make install, but if you wish to use it with ROS then it will build as a unary stack. \r\n\r\nSerial is a class that provides the basic interface common to serial libraries (open, close, read, write, etc..) and requires no extra dependencies. It also provides tight control over timeouts and control over handshaking lines. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking for more utilities related to interfacing with sensors and serial devices, checkout my serial_utils github project: serial_utils. It provides tools for asynchronous reading and related tasks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation for all versions of the serial library can be found here.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* catkin - cmake and Python based buildsystem\r\n * cmake - buildsystem\r\n * Python - scripting language\r\n * empy - Python templating library\r\n * catkin_pkg - Runtime Python library for catkin\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nGet the code:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git\r\n\r\nBuild:\r\n\r\n    make\r\n\r\nBuild and run the tests:\r\n\r\n    make test\r\n\r\nBuild the documentation:\r\n\r\n    make docs\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n\r\n    make install\r\n\r\nUninstall:\r\n\r\n    make uninstall\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThe BSD License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 William Woodall, John Harrison \r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: \r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. \r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
